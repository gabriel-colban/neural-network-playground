# Neural network playground

This repo is a coding playground for me to learn neural network

The goal is to create a neural network that can predict wether given coordinates (x, y and z) is inside a room.

I am doing this to better my understanding of neural networks, hopefully this will allow me to better build models using existing libraries.
